Directions: To start the program the entry point is src/main/java/scheduling/demoschedulingapp/SchedulingApplication.java.
The dbUtils file must be updated with the proper information (i.e. your username and password for the database you intend to use as well as your password).
I would highly recommend you remove the dbutils from the git repository before saving your information. and use an encryption for your password.

The additional report in this application is simply a bar chart showing which client has the most appointments.
